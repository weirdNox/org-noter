* Org-noter: an interleaving/note-taking package for documents
  [[https://melpa.org/#/org-noter][file:https://melpa.org/packages/org-noter-badge.svg]] 
  [[https://coveralls.io/github/org-noter/org-noter?branch=master][file:https://coveralls.io/repos/github/org-noter/org-noter/badge.svg?branch=master]]

  ~Org-noter~, by [[https://github.com/weirdNox][Gon√ßalo Santos]], was inspired by the now-orphaned ~Interleave~
  package, by [[https://github.com/rudolfochrist][Sebastian Christ]].  In Sebastian's words (with minor edits):

  #+begin_quote
  In the past, textbooks were sometimes published as interleaved editions. That
  meant, each page was followed by a blank page and ambitious students/scholars
  had the ability to take their notes directly in their copy of the
  textbook. Newton and Kant were prominent representatives of this
  technique. [find reference]

  Nowadays, textbooks (or lecture materials) come in PDF format. Although almost
  every PDF Reader has the ability to add some notes to the PDF itself, it is
  not as powerful as it could be. This is what this Emacs minor mode tries to
  accomplish. It presents your PDF side by side with an Org Mode buffer of your
  notes, narrowed down to just those passages that are relevant to this
  particular page in the document viewer.
  #+end_quote

  Org-noter's purpose is to let you create notes that are kept in sync when you
  scroll through the document, but that are external to it - the notes
  themselves live in an Org-mode file.  As such, this leverages the power of
  [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] (the notes may have outlines, latex fragments, babel, etc...) while
  acting like notes that are made /inside/ the document.  Also, taking notes is
  very simple: just press =i= and annotate away!

  Org-noter is compatible with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Document-View.html][DocView]], [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][PDF Tools]], [[https://depp.brause.cc/nov.el/][Nov.el]], and
  [[DJVU-read][DJVU-image-mode]]. These modes make it possible to annotate *PDF*, *EPUB*,
  *Microsoft Office*, DVI, PS, OpenDocument, and DJVU formatted files.  Note
  that PDF support is our prime goal.  Other format have been supported by other
  contributors, but we need code contributions from users of other formats to
  maintain/progress usability with those formats.

** Features
*** original org-noter (up to 2019)
- Easy to use annotation interface :: Just press =i= in the
     document buffer and annotate away!

- Keep your notes in sync with the document :: When you take a note by pressing
     =i=, it saves the location where you took it so it is able to show you
     the notes while you scroll, automatically!

- Easy navigation :: You may navigate your document as usual, seeing the notes buffer scroll and show you
     the respective notes; however, you may also navigate by notes, only seeing annotated pages/chapters.

- Isolated interface :: Each session has its own frame and the document and notes buffers are indirect
     buffers to the original ones. Killing any of these things will terminate your annotation session.

- Simultaneous sessions :: You may open as many annotation sessions as you wish, at the same time! The
     root heading of each document will be made read-only to prevent you from deleting a heading from an
     open session.

- Resume annotating from where you left :: When ~org-noter-auto-save-last-location~ is non-nil, it will
     save the last location you visited and pick it up when you start another session! You may also set
     this per-document, [[#custom][read more here]].

- Keep your notes organized :: You may arrange your notes however you want! You can create groups and
     nest notes (and even nest documents inside other documents)!

- Annotate ~org-attach~'ed files :: If you have any attached files, it will let you choose one as
     the document to annotate.

*** new (all formats)
    - ~org-noter-enable-update-renames~ :: Optional feature to update document
      paths when renaming or moving document files or notes files.  This allows
      you to change your mind later about the names and locations of your
      document files and notes files without having to manually update all the
      links.

    - ~org-noter-toggle-notes-window-location~ (~M-T~) :: Toggle between
      horizontal and vertical document/notes layout.

    - ~org-noter-start-from-dired~ (Suggested keybinding: ~M-s n~) :: Start
      sessions directly from ~dired~.  Opens all marked files or the file at
      point if none are marked.

*** new (PDFs only with the [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools][pdftools]] package)
    - 2D precise notes :: ([[https://github.com/ahmed-shariff/org-noter][Ahmed Shariff]]) Location tooltip appears at start of
      selected text or point of click.

    - Multicolumn ordering of precise notes :: With the ~COLUMN_EDGES~ property,
      you can specify the number of columns in a multicolumn document (or pages
      thereof).  Precise notes are ordered vertically within columns.  Use
      ~M-x org-noter-pdf-set-columns~ to interactively set ~COLUMN_EDGES~ for
      the current heading.  The property is inheritable, so it can be set at the
      page, chapter/section, or document level.  See [[file:docs/HOWTO.org]] for
      more details.

    - Highlighting of selected text :: Default behavior (on/off) is
      user-customizable via ~org-noter-highlight-selected-text~.  Non-default
      behavior is activated with a =C-u= prefix to the note insertion command.

    - Customizable tooltip arrow colors :: ~org-noter-arrow-foreground-color~ (default
      orange-red) and ~org-noter-arrow-foreground-color~ (default white) are
      both user customizable.

** Usage

If you want to give it a try without much trouble:
- Open an Org file where you want the notes to go.
- Create a root heading to hold the notes.
- Run =M-x org-noter= inside the Org file.
  On the first run, it will ask you for the path of the document and save it in a
  property. By default, it will also let you annotate an attached file [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Attachments.html][(org-attach documentation)]].

This will open a new dedicated frame where you can use [[#keys][the keybindings described here]].

More generally, there are two modes of operation. You may run
=M-x org-noter=:
- Inside a heading in an Org notes file :: This will associate that heading with a
     document and open a session with it. This mode is the one described in the example
     above.

- In a document :: Run =M-x org-noter= when viewing a
                   document (eg. PDF, epub...).

                   This will try to find the respective notes file automatically. It will
                   search in all parent folders and some specific folders set by you. See
                   ~org-noter-default-notes-file-names~ and ~org-noter-notes-search-path~
                   for more information.

There is, of course, more information in the docstrings of each command.

** TODO Customization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: custom
   :END:

See [[file:docs/CUSTOMIZATIONS.org]] for examples of user & maintainer customizations
to this package.

There are two kinds of customizations you may do:
1. Global settings, affecting every session
2. Document-specific settings, which override the global settings

The *global settings* are changed with either the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Easy-Customization.html#Easy-Customization][customization interface from Emacs]] or directly in your
init file. To find which settings are available, you may use the customization interface or you may just
read =org-noter.el=.

The best way to set *document-specific settings* is by using the utility commands provided (list below).
In order to use them, you need an open session. The commands may change the settings for that session
only (not surviving restarts), or for every session with that document.

*List of utility commands* (check the docstrings to learn how to make the changes
permanent, or revert to the default):
- You may set a start location for this document, by using ~org-noter-set-start-location~.

- To automatically resume from where you left, use ~org-noter-set-auto-save-last-location~.

- With ~org-noter-set-notes-window-behavior~, you may change /when/ the notes window pops
  up.

- With ~org-noter-set-notes-window-location~, you may change /where/ the notes window pops
  up.

- ~org-noter-set-doc-split-fraction~ will ask you for the fraction of the frame that the document window
  occupies when split.

- ~org-noter-set-hide-other~ will toggle whether or not it should hide headings not
  related to the executed action.

- ~org-noter-set-closest-tipping-point~ will set the closest note tipping point. Also
  check the docstring of the variable ~org-noter-closest-tipping-point~ in order to better
  understand the tipping point.

** Keybindings and commands
   :PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: keys
:END:
| Key        | Description                              | Where?                    |
| =i=        | Insert note                              | Document buffer           |
| =C-i, TAB= | Insert note, toggle no-questions         | Document buffer           |
| =M-i=      | Insert precise note                      | Document buffer           |
| =C-M-i=    | Insert precise note, toggle no-questions | Document buffer           |
| =q=        | Kill session                             | Document buffer           |
| =M-p=      | Sync previous page/chapter               | Document and notes buffer |
| =M-.=      | Sync current page/chapter                | Document and notes buffer |
| =M-n=      | Sync next page/chapter                   | Document and notes buffer |
| =C-M-p=    | Sync previous notes                      | Document and notes buffer |
| =C-M-.=    | Sync selected notes                      | Document and notes buffer |
| =C-M-n=    | Sync next notes                          | Document and notes buffer |

You can use the usual keybindings to navigate the document
(=n=, =p=, =SPC=, ...).

There are two types of sync commands:
- To sync a page/chapter, means it will find the [previous|current|next] page/chapter and
  show the corresponding notes for that page/chapter; as such, it will always pop up the
  notes buffer, if it does not exist. This type of command is in relation to the current
  page/chapter in the document.

- To sync the notes, means it will find the [previous|current|next] notes and go to the
  corresponding location on the document. So, you need to have the notes window open,
  because this type of commands is in relation to the selected notes (ie, where the cursor
  is).

When using PDF Tools, the command ~org-noter-create-skeleton~ imports the PDF outline or
annotations (or both!) as notes, and it may be used, for example, as a starting point.

You may also want to check the docstrings of the functions associated with the
keybindings, because there is some extra functionality in some.

** Changes to note insertion since version 1.4.1 (MELPA version 20191020.1212)
   - more consistent use of selected text in title or body
   - more consistent primary default title (short-selected-text)
   - more consistent secondary default title ("Notes for page <location>")
   - avoids having different notes with the same heading

     Previously, repeated TAB's give multiple notes.  Now, new notes in the same
     location with the same title are not made, but selected text is added to
     the note body.  Precise notes are excepted from this rule.

   - *long* text-selections are enclosed in #+BEGIN_QUOTE...#+END_QUOTE
   - *short* text-selections are enclosed in ``...'' (LaTeX style) when they are
     not used as the title of the note.
   - short/long text-selections are differentiated by the custom variable
     =org-noter-max-short-selected-text-length= (default: 80 char)

     Previously, long selections were those with more than 3 lines.
