* Customizations
  Out of respect for the existing user base of =org-noter=, almost all of the
  user-interface features of this fork remain the same those of as the original
  =org-noter=.  However, users may be interested in our variations on the theme
  of Gon√ßalos Santos.

   In order of frequency, I use precise notes the most, standard notes next and
   no-questions notes the least, so I have bound keys to reflect those
   preferences with =i= for precise notes, =TAB= for standard notes; for
   no-questions (no-prompt) notes, =I= is for precise notes and =M-i= for
   standard notes.:
   #+begin_src elisp
     (with-eval-after-load 'org-noter
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "i")   'org-noter-insert-precise-note)
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "C-i") 'org-noter-insert-note)
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "I")   'org-noter-insert-precise-note-toggle-no-questions)
       (define-key org-noter-doc-mode-map (kbd "M-i") 'org-noter-insert-note-toggle-no-questions))
   #+end_src

   For navigation, I use =..-sync-..-note= more than =..-sync-..-page-..=, so I
   bound the =note= commands to the easier-to-type =M-[p.n]= bindings and the
   less-used =page-..= commands to the harder-to-type =C-M-[p.n]= bindings.
   #+begin_src elisp

   In the original code, the tooltip arrow on PDFs is *Orange-Red on White*,
   which works fine when the arrow is always on the left side of the page.  I
   found that with the 2D precise notes introduced by Ahmed Shariff, I sometime
   had trouble locating the arrow as I navigated through my notes.  The *Black
   on Cyan* color-scheme that I use is more jarring, hence easier to locate.
   #+begin_src elisp
     (with-eval-after-load 'org-noter
       (setq org-noter-arrow-background-color "cyan"
       org-noter-arrow-foreground-color "black"))

** Dmitry's mods

   [TODO]

** Lamprinos' mods (user)
   @chatziiola prefers "notes.org" as his default notes name, vs the default
   default notes name "Notes.org".  He also chooses to change the default
   ~org-noter-notes-search-path~ from ~~/Documents~ to something else.

In plain ~straight.el~ syntax
#+begin_src elisp
  (straight-use-package 'org-noter)
  (setq org-noter-notes-search-path        '("~/your/path/to/notes"))
  (setq org-noter-default-notes-file-names '("notes.org"))
#+end_src

*** straight.el + use-package
For all those that use ~straight.el~ along with ~use-package~
#+begin_src elisp
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)

  (use-package org-noter
               :config
               (setq org-noter-notes-search-path        '("~/your/path/to/notes"))
               (setq org-noter-default-notes-file-names '("notes.org"))
               ;; Include this only next block only if you use ~evil~ with ~general~
               :general
               (general-nmap
                :keymaps '(org-noter-mode-map pdf-view-mode-map)
                "I" 'org-noter-insert-note-toggle-no-questions
                "i" 'org-noter-insert-note))
