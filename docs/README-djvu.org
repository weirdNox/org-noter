* Org-noter + DJVU - A fork of [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][org-noter]] with [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/djvu.html][djvu.el]] support.
** What is org-noter?
Org-noter is an org-mode document annotator. It is a rewrite of another project, [[https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave][Interleave]].
Read about org-noter‚Äôs feature/usage/customization in its README [[file:README-orig.org][here]] or go visit its repository at [[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][github]].
** Added features
 - =org-noter= can be used on djvu file.
 - =org-noter-create-skeleton= now works on djvu and pdf file.
 - Allow =:NOTER_DOCUMENT:= to be in file-level =:PROPERTIES:= drawer
   See the issue https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter/issues/143 for details.
 - There is a module in the [[file:other/][other/]] directory called
   [[file:other/org-noter-nov-overlay.el][org-noter-nov-overlay]] that highlights your notes with overlays in
   nov-mode, to use it, either add it to your =load-path= or with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]],
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package org-noter-nov-overlay
      :ensure nil)
#+end_src

** Goals
 - [ ] Precise location support djvu.el have both graphical (via
   =djvu-image-mode=) and textual (default) modes so maybe the textual
   mode should handle precise location like nov.el and graphical mode
   should do it like pdf-tools.
** Installation
*** Manual installation
1. Clone this repo =git clone https://notabug.org/c1-g/org-noter-plus-djvu.git=
2. Add it to your =load-path=.
** Caveats
*** This is a fork of a fork üç¥
The branch =djvu= (the only one I‚Äôd worked on so far) of this repository is based on Ahmed Shariff‚Äôs pull request of org-noter
(See https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter/pull/129).

*** Conflicting keybindings
The key @@html:<kbd>@@i@@html:</kbd>@@ (lowercase i) for inserting
note in the document buffer will conflict with the default key to
enter =djvu-image-mode=. So either you rebind one of them or you can
just enter =djvu-image-mode= manually via @@html:<kbd>@@M-x djvu-image-mode@@html:</kbd>@@
